Invitation files

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the invitation.

Customize:
- Edit `index.html`: set `LAT`, `LNG`, and `ADDRESS` variables at the top of the inline script.
- Update host name, time, and RSVP number.

How the buttons work:
- "Open in Google Maps" opens the address or coordinates in Google Maps.
- "Navigate (Directions)" opens Google Maps directions with your location as the origin and the invitation coordinates as destination.

If you'd like, I can plug your exact address and phone number into the file, or generate a shareable image/PDF version.
